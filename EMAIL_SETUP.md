## Fallback: Development Console Mode

If you don't want to set up any email service right now, the system will automatically log reset links to the console when RESEND_API_KEY is not configured.

## Test the Complete Flow

1. Create a user account at http://localhost:3000/sign-up
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/sign-in
3. Click "Reset password"
4. Enter your email
5. Check email (or console if not configured)
6. Click the reset link
7. Set a new password

That's it! Modern email setup complete! ðŸŽ‰
